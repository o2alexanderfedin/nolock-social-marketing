## Mapping Analysis

### Alignment Areas

✅ **Introduction**: Both structures begin with a title slide introducing NoLock Social.

✅ **Problem Statement**: Both structures dedicate 3 slides to explaining the problem (slides 2-4).

✅ **Vision**: Both include vision slides at a similar position (slide 5 in both).

### Differences

❗ **Market Opportunity**: The investor pitch deck includes a market opportunity slide (slide 6) that isn't explicitly mentioned in the source of truth.

❗ **Business Model**: The investor pitch deck includes a business model slide (slide 8) that isn't explicitly mentioned in the source of truth.

❗ **Investment Ask**: The investor pitch deck ends with an investment ask slide (slide 21), which is aligned with the "Next Steps" section in the source of truth but has a different focus.

### Potential Reorganization (If Needed)

If reorganization were required (not being done now), slides could be arranged as follows to more closely match the source of truth:

1. **Introduction**: Slide 01 (title)
2. **Problem Statement**: Slides 02-04 (current slides already match)
3. **Vision and Solution**: Slides 05-07 (vision and solution)
4. **Technical Approach**: Slides about technology, CAS, etc.
5. **Benefits and Applications**: Slides about advantages, innovations, etc.
6. **Next Steps**: Slide 21 (investment ask) and team information

## Key Observations

1. The investor pitch deck is appropriately focused on business aspects (market opportunity, business model, investment ask) that would interest investors.

2. The source of truth structure is more product and technology-focused, with more emphasis on technical approaches and benefits.

3. While the structures have differences, they both address the key components needed for their respective audiences.

4. The current investor pitch deck structure effectively adapts the source of truth for an investor audience without losing the essential messaging.
