FLEXIBLE INTEGRATION APPROACHES

THREE LEVELS OF PARTNERSHIP INTEGRATION:

1. API INTEGRATION
   • Standard REST APIs with developer portal
   • Verification as a Service model
   • Lowest implementation effort

2. HYBRID INTEGRATION
   • Combined API and storage integration
   • Partial deduplication benefits
   • Moderate implementation effort

3. FULL INFRASTRUCTURE INTEGRATION
   • Complete CAS implementation
   • Maximum storage optimization
   • Advanced verification capabilities
```

## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"We understand that different partners have varying technical needs and resources, so we've developed three flexible integration approaches that scale with your requirements."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "Our API Integration offers the fastest path to adding verification capabilities through standard REST APIs, ideal for partners wanting to quickly add content verification without significant infrastructure changes."
2. "The Hybrid Integration model combines our APIs with partial storage integration, delivering moderate deduplication benefits while maintaining most of your existing infrastructure."
3. "For maximum benefit, our Full Infrastructure Integration delivers complete CAS implementation with all storage optimization and verification capabilities, ideal for partners looking for transformative efficiency."

**Customization message:**
"We can customize these approaches for your specific technical environment and business requirements, creating a tailored integration plan that delivers maximum value while respecting your existing investments."

**Technical governance:**
"All integration options include comprehensive documentation, developer support, and standardized testing frameworks to ensure reliable performance and compatibility."

**Partner selection guidance:**
"Most partners begin with API Integration to demonstrate value, then progress to deeper integration as the business case is validated through measurable results."

## Industry-Specific Examples

"Financial services partners typically start with API Integration focused on document verification, while media companies often move directly to Hybrid Integration to capture immediate storage savings alongside verification benefits."
