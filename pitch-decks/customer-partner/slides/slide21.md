## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"This appendix provides detailed technical specifications for reference during your technical evaluation and planning process."

**Performance metrics explanation:**
1. "Our content retrieval averages less than 50ms response time, ensuring excellent user experience even with large content volumes."
2. "Verification processing completes in under 100ms for standard content, enabling real-time verification in interactive applications."
3. "Storage efficiency typically shows 35-45% reduction compared to traditional storage approaches through native deduplication."
4. "API throughput exceeds 1000 requests per second per instance, with linear scaling through additional instances."

**Security specifications emphasis:**
1. "We use AES-256 encryption for content protection and TLS 1.3 for secure transport, meeting or exceeding industry standards."
2. "Authentication supports OAuth 2.0 and SAML out of the box, with custom JWT integration for specialized environments."
3. "Our verification system uses SHA-256 content hashing with signature chains, creating cryptographically secure verification."
4. "Compliance capabilities support GDPR and CCPA requirements, with SOC 2 Type 2 certification in progress."

**Deployment options highlights:**
1. "The system is cloud-native with full Kubernetes support, enabling deployment in any cloud environment."
2. "On-premises deployment is available for organizations with specific security or regulatory requirements."
3. "Hybrid deployment with synchronized nodes enables flexible deployment across environments while maintaining consistency."
4. "Edge deployment options provide low-latency verification for performance-sensitive applications."

**Technical documentation:**
"Complete technical documentation is available in our partner portal, including architecture diagrams, API references, and implementation guides."

## Tailoring Guidance

This slide is included as an appendix for reference and should only be presented if there are specific technical questions that require detailed specifications. It can also be provided as follow-up material after the presentation.
