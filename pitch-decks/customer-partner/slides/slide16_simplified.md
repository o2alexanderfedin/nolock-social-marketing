- **Three-Phase Process**: Clear visualization of implementation journey
- **Timeline**: Visual representation of typical phase durations
- **Milestone Indicators**: Key points in the implementation process
- **Resource Requirements**: Simple visualization of typical team needs

## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"We've developed a structured implementation process that minimizes risk and accelerates time-to-market for our partnership."

**Implementation phases:**
1. "Discovery & Planning begins with a technical assessment and creates a detailed implementation roadmap with clear milestones."
2. "Technical Implementation includes development environment setup, integration, testing, and performance optimization."
3. "Market Preparation focuses on go-to-market planning, joint marketing assets, and comprehensive sales enablement."

**Timeline expectations:**
"The typical timeline runs 8-12 weeks from initial exploration to partnership launch, with most implementations seeing benefits within 60 days."

**Resource requirements:**
"Most implementations require 1-2 developers from your team during the technical phase, with minimal ongoing maintenance."

**Risk mitigation:**
"Each stage includes clear decision points and success criteria, allowing both organizations to validate value before deeper commitments."

**Remember**: Emphasize the structured, low-risk nature of the implementation process. Partners want predictable timelines and resource requirements.
