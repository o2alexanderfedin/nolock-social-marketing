# Slide 8: Content-Addressable Storage for Partners

![CAS Technology](../images/slide8.png)

## Content Type: Technology

```
CONTENT-ADDRESSABLE STORAGE FOR PARTNERS

• Seamless integration with existing storage
• 40% reduction in storage costs
• Verification built into storage layer
• Flexible deployment: cloud or on-premises
```

## Design Elements

- **Headline**: Original technology headline preserved
- **Storage Visualization**: Clear representation of content-addressable storage
- **Integration Diagram**: Visual showing connection to existing systems
- **Cost Savings Chart**: Simple visualization of 40% reduction
- **Deployment Options**: Cloud and on-premises icons

## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"Our Content-Addressable Storage technology is designed specifically for partner integration, providing immediate benefits without disrupting your architecture."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "The system integrates seamlessly with your existing storage systems through standard APIs and protocols."
2. "Native deduplication at the content level enables typical storage cost reductions of 40% in enterprise implementations."
3. "Verification is built directly into the storage layer, eliminating separate verification systems and processes."
4. "You can deploy in your preferred environment—cloud, on-premises, or hybrid—with consistent performance."

**Technical differentiation:**
"Unlike other CAS implementations, our system is optimized for enterprise performance with 40% faster retrieval times and significantly reduced storage requirements."

**Integration example:**
"A media partner integrated this technology with their content management system in just four weeks, immediately reducing storage costs while adding verification capabilities."

**Remember**: Focus on the partner benefits of CAS rather than technical implementation details. The next slide will address integration options more specifically.
