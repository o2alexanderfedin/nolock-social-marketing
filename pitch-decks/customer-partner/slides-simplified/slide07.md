![Technical Architecture](../images/slide7.png)

## Content Type: Technology

```
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

CORE COMPONENTS
‚Ä¢ Content-Addressable Storage layer
‚Ä¢ Trust Network Protocol
‚Ä¢ JavaScript-compatible API

INTEGRATION POINTS
‚Ä¢ REST APIs for verification
‚Ä¢ Storage connectors for platforms
```

## Design Elements

- **Headline**: Original technical headline preserved
- **Two-Column Layout**: Core components and integration points clearly separated
- **Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of the technical stack
- **Component Relationships**: Flow chart showing interconnections
- **Integration Icons**: Visual indicators of compatible systems

## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"Our technical architecture combines three core components with multiple integration points, adapting to your existing ecosystem."

**Core components explanation:**
1. "The Content-Addressable Storage layer provides the foundation, enabling content verification and deduplication through cryptographic properties."
2. "The Trust Network Protocol enables secure content sharing with granular permissions across organizational boundaries."
3. "Our JavaScript-compatible API layer ensures simple integration with applications, frameworks, and existing systems."

**Integration points emphasis:**
1. "We provide standard REST APIs for verification services that integrate with minimal development effort."
2. "Storage connectors for major platforms enable bidirectional synchronization with existing content repositories."

**Technical differentiation:**
"Unlike blockchain approaches that require complex consensus mechanisms, our architecture optimizes for both performance and security without compromise."

**Implementation flexibility:**
"Each component can be implemented independently based on your specific business needs and technical requirements."

**Remember**: Keep this slide focused on architecture clarity. Subsequent slides will detail specific components and integration approaches.
