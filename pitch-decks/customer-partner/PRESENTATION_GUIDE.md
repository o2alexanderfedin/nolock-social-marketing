   - Have a backup plan if technical issues arise

2. **Make it Relevant**
   - Use industry-specific examples in demonstrations
   - If possible, use their data or similar data in examples
   - Explain benefits in their business terms, not just technical terms

3. **Emphasize Integration**
   - Show how it works with technologies they already use
   - Demonstrate API calls and integration points
   - Highlight documentation and developer resources

## Success Criteria

Consider the presentation successful if:

1. You've established a clear next step with a specific timeframe
2. They've identified a potential use case or integration point
3. They've agreed to involve additional stakeholders (technical or business)
4. They've shared specific challenges our solution might address
5. They've expressed interest in a particular partnership model

Remember, the goal is to begin a partnership exploration, not close a deal in a single meeting.
