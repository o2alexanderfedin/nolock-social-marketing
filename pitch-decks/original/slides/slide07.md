![Fragmentation](../images/slide7.png)

## Content Type: Problem Synthesis

```
THE FRAGMENTED DIGITAL LANDSCAPE

• Disconnected content silos controlled by platforms
• No interoperability or portability between services
• User attention and data scattered across applications
• Digital identity fractured and inconsistent
```

## Design Elements

- **Headline**: Bold, attention-grabbing typography presenting the key concept
- **Bullet Points**: Concise statements highlighting the main aspects
- **Supporting Visual**: Clear visual representation of the concept
- **Layout**: Professional organization with clear hierarchy
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent with overall presentation branding

## Pitch Notes

**Key message:**
"This slide provides a synthetic view of the fragmentation problem in digital services, showing how our current approach creates fundamental inefficiencies and poor user experiences."

**Supporting points:**
1. "Disconnected content silos controlled by platforms"
2. "No interoperability or portability between services"
3. "User attention and data scattered across applications"
4. "Digital identity fractured and inconsistent"

**Evidence/Impact:**
"The fragmented digital landscape isn't just inconvenient—it represents a structural inefficiency that costs users time, reduces information quality, and prevents the emergence of truly valuable digital experiences."

## Follow-Up Slide

This slide connects to the next slide, continuing the logical flow of the presentation narrative.
