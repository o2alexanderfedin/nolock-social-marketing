# Slide 3: Bad Actors

![Bad Actors Problem](../images/slide3.png)

## Content Type: Problem Statement

```
THE CONTENT QUALITY CRISIS

‚Ä¢ Platforms flooded with spam, scams, and misinformation
‚Ä¢ Centralized moderation creates inconsistent results
‚Ä¢ Valuable voices suppressed by imperfect algorithms
‚Ä¢ Trust in digital information reaches historic low
```

## Design Elements

- **Headline**: Compelling problem framing as a "crisis"
- **Bullet Points**: Four concise statements highlighting content quality issues
- **Supporting Visual**: Diagram showing how bad actors infiltrate platforms while good content gets blocked
- **Color Signals**: Visual indication of problematic content vs. valuable content
- **Layout**: Clean organization with clear visual hierarchy

## Pitch Notes

**Problem framing:**
"Beyond fragmentation, we face a profound crisis of content quality and trust in digital spaces."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "Despite massive investment in content moderation, platforms remain overwhelmed by spam, scams, and misinformation."
2. "Centralized moderation systems create both false positives‚Äîblocking legitimate speech‚Äîand false negatives‚Äîallowing harmful content."
3. "Algorithmic filters often suppress valuable minority voices while amplifying sensational, divisive content."
4. "The result is a digital landscape where trust in information has reached a historic low, with only 34% of users trusting content they see online."

**Real-world impact:**
"This isn't just a platform problem‚Äîit's a societal issue affecting public discourse, mental health, and the fundamental utility of our digital spaces."

## Expert Validation

"According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report, trust in online information has declined for five consecutive years, creating what researchers call an 'epistemic crisis' in digital spaces."

## Follow-Up Slide

This content quality problem connects directly to Slide 4, which addresses the related issue of information overload and complete banning of certain users.
