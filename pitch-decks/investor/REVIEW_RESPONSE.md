# Addressing Investor Review Feedback

This document outlines how the investor-focused pitch deck addresses the concerns and suggestions raised in the original investor review.

## Primary Concerns Addressed

### 1. Visual-Text Ratio
**Original Concern:** Several slides appear text-heavy with limited visual distinction.

**How We Addressed It:**
- Reduced text on all slides (max 15-20 words per key point)
- Enhanced visual elements to support key messages
- Created clear visual hierarchy on each slide
- Designed slides for verbal narration rather than reading

### 2. Investment Thesis Clarity
**Original Concern:** The deck doesn't explicitly address the business model, revenue generation, or market size.

**How We Addressed It:**
- Added dedicated "Business Model" slide ([Slide 5](slides/slide05.md)) with clear revenue streams
- Created "Market Opportunity" slide ([Slide 4](slides/slide04.md)) with specific TAM/SAM/SOM figures
- Added "Investment Ask" slide ([Slide 12](slides/slide12.md)) with clear funding request and use of funds
- Included explicit market size ($12.13B) and growth rate (25% CAGR) in title slide

### 3. Technical vs. Business Balance
**Original Concern:** The presentation leans heavily toward technical details with less emphasis on business viability.

**How We Addressed It:**
- Restructured deck to lead with business opportunity (Slides 1-5)
- Reduced technical slides from 7 to 2
- Translated technical innovations into business advantages
- Added Go-to-Market strategy and traction slides
- Repositioned technical content to support business narrative

### 4. Proof Points
**Original Concern:** Many claims lack quantification or third-party validation.

**How We Addressed It:**
- Added specific market data with sources
- Included concrete metrics for product performance
- Added specific user acquisition targets and costs
- Quantified benefits (e.g., "3x more efficient," "40% performance improvement")
- Referenced partnerships and existing traction

### 5. Differentiation Clarity
**Original Concern:** While technical differentiation is detailed, comparative advantage could be stronger.

**How We Addressed It:**
- Added dedicated "Competitive Landscape" slide ([Slide 8](slides/slide08.md))
- Created specific positioning against both centralized and decentralized alternatives
- Highlighted unique advantages for each market segment
- Emphasized business differentiation, not just technical
