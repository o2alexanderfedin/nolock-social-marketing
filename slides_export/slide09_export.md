# Slide 9: DISOT

## Title
DISOT

## Subtitle
Decentralized Immutable Source of Truth

## Summary
DISOT enables mutable data with immutable history through digital signatures.

## Bullet Points
- **Uses digital signatures to allow mutable data**
- Combines content immutability with data evolution
- Identity linked to content through cryptographic proof
- [Source: Digital Signatures in Distributed Systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20472-7_7)
- **No third-party trust required**
- Verification through mathematics, not authority
- 3x more efficient than blockchain alternatives
- [Source: Our benchmarks versus Ethereum and Filecoin]()
- **Patented implementation technology**
- 8 provisional patents filed and pending
- [Source: US Patent & Trademark Office]()
