## About NoLock Social

NoLock Social is a project aimed at rebuilding trust in the digital space through a fundamentally different approach to content creation, ownership, and social connections.

We are creating an ecosystem built on three core technologies:

1. **Universal Content-Addressable Storage (CAS)** - A decentralized data layer where content is identified by its cryptographic hash
2. **Decentralized Identity** - User-controlled identities linked to verifiable content
3. **Networks of Trust** - Personal social networks built on weighted subjective trust

### Key Advantages

NoLock Social offers several unique advantages over traditional platforms:

- **Future-Proof**: Easy protocol and cryptography upgrades without data loss
- **Offline Functionality**: Works reliably without constant internet connectivity
- **Verifiable Content**: Every piece of content has cryptographic proof of authenticity
- **Personalized Trust**: Networks built on real relationships, not algorithms
