## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"We've developed a straightforward process to explore partnership opportunities and validate mutual value."

**Process explanation:**
1. "We begin with a Technical Assessment including a solution architecture workshop to align on integration approach and requirements."
2. "In parallel, we conduct Business Alignment to select the optimal partnership model and define value-sharing arrangements."
3. "With alignment established, we move to a Pilot Implementation with a focused proof of concept and clear success metrics."

**Immediate next steps:**
"Based on today's discussion, we recommend scheduling a technical deep dive with your architecture team and a business model workshop with your product leadership."

**Timeframe expectation:**
"Typically, this exploration process takes 8-12 weeks from initial assessment to partnership launch, with most partners seeing their first implementation benefits within 60 days."

**Commitment level:**
"Each stage includes clear decision points, allowing both organizations to validate the partnership value before proceeding to deeper commitments."

**Remember**: This slide should create a clear, simple path forward with an obvious immediate next step that has low commitment barriers.
