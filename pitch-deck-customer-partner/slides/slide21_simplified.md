## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"This reference slide provides the key technical specifications you'll need during technical evaluation."

**Performance specifications:**
1. "Content retrieval averages less than 50ms response time, ensuring excellent user experience even with large volumes."
2. "API throughput exceeds 1000 requests per second per instance, with linear scaling through additional instances."

**Security specifications:**
1. "We use AES-256 for content encryption and TLS 1.3 for transport, meeting or exceeding industry standards."
2. "Content verification uses SHA-256 hashing with signature chains for cryptographically secure verification."

**Deployment options:**
1. "The system is cloud-native with full Kubernetes support for deployment in any cloud environment."
2. "On-premises and hybrid deployment options are available for specific security or regulatory requirements."

**Additional resources:**
"Complete technical documentation is available in our partner portal, including architecture diagrams and API references."

**Remember**: This is an appendix slide. Mention that detailed specifications will be provided as follow-up materials after the presentation.
