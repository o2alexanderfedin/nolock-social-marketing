![Enterprise Security](../images/slide11.png)

## Content Type: Value Proposition

```
ENTERPRISE-GRADE SECURITY

• Zero-knowledge encryption architecture
• Tamper-evident cryptographic audit logs
• Role-based access with granular controls
• GDPR & SOC 2 compliance framework
```

## Design Elements

- **Headline**: Simplified security-focused headline
- **Security Icons**: Visual representations of key security features
- **Compliance Badges**: Visual indicators of security standards
- **Security Layers**: Diagram showing defense-in-depth approach
- **Access Control**: Visual of role-based permission structure

## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"Security is fundamental to our architecture, with enterprise-grade features designed for the most demanding regulated industries."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "Our zero-knowledge encryption ensures only authorized users access unencrypted content, with no backdoors or overrides."
2. "Tamper-evident audit logs create cryptographically verified records of all system activities for compliance and security."
3. "Role-based access controls provide granular permissions at both system and content levels, integrating with your identity management."
4. "We provide a comprehensive compliance framework supporting GDPR requirements, with SOC 2 certification in progress."

**Security differentiation:**
"Unlike solutions with security as an add-on layer, our architecture makes security fundamental—content is inherently verified through cryptographic properties."

**Industry specifics:**
- For financial services: "Our architecture meets financial institution security requirements, including audit trails and data integrity validation."
- For healthcare: "We support HIPAA compliance requirements with specific features for PHI handling."

**Remember**: Focus on security as a business enabler, not just a technical feature. Security creates trust for partners and their customers.
