## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"The first critical challenge our partnership addresses is the growing content verification crisis affecting organizations across industries."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "With sophisticated manipulation technologies, content authenticity is increasingly difficult to verify, creating both liability and trust issues."
