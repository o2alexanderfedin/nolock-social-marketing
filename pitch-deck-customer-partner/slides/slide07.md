## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"Our technical architecture combines five core components with multiple integration points, creating a flexible foundation that adapts to your existing technology ecosystem."

**Core components explanation:**
1. "The Content-Addressable Storage layer provides the foundation, enabling content verification and deduplication through cryptographic principles."
2. "Our Decentralized Immutable Source of Truth creates verifiable records with tamper-proof properties for audit and compliance purposes."
3. "The Trust Network Protocol enables secure content sharing with granular permissions and verification across organizational boundaries."
4. "Our JavaScript-compatible API layer ensures easy integration with web applications, modern development frameworks, and existing systems."
5. "The Integration Framework provides pre-built connectors for major platforms, simplifying implementation and reducing integration time."

**Integration points emphasis:**
1. "We offer standard REST APIs for verification services that can be quickly integrated with minimal development effort."
2. "Storage connectors for major platforms enable bidirectional synchronization with existing content repositories."
3. "Native libraries for common development environments allow direct integration into application code."
4. "Authentication integration with existing systems maintains your current security model while adding verification capabilities."

**Technical differentiation:**
"Unlike blockchain approaches that require consensus mechanisms, or traditional hash databases that lack comprehensive content addressing, our architecture optimizes for both performance and security without compromising either."

**Implementation flexibility:**
"Each component can be implemented independently or as part of a comprehensive solution, allowing you to prioritize based on your specific business needs and technical requirements."

## Tailoring Guidance

When presenting this slide, emphasize the components and integration points most relevant to the partner's technical environment and current product offerings.

## Follow-Up Slide

This technical architecture overview connects to Slide 8, which details the Content-Addressable Storage technology specifically for partners.
