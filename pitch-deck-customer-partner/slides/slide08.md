## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"Our Content-Addressable Storage technology is designed for seamless integration with your existing infrastructure, providing immediate benefits without disrupting your current architecture."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "We've engineered our CAS system with integration as a first principle - it works alongside your existing storage systems through standard APIs and protocols."
2. "The native deduplication functions at the content level, not just the file level, enabling storage cost reductions of up to 40% in typical enterprise implementations."
3. "Content verification is built directly into the storage layer, eliminating the need for separate verification systems or processes."
4. "The system is optimized for both structured data like database records and unstructured data like documents and media files."
5. "You can deploy our technology in your preferred environment - cloud, on-premises, or hybrid - with consistent performance and capabilities."

**Technical differentiation:**
"Unlike other CAS implementations like IPFS, our system is optimized for enterprise performance, with 40% faster retrieval times and significantly reduced storage requirements through our proprietary algorithms."

**Integration example:**
"For example, a media partner integrated our CAS technology with their existing content management system in just four weeks, immediately reducing storage costs while adding content verification capabilities that enabled them to meet new regulatory requirements."
