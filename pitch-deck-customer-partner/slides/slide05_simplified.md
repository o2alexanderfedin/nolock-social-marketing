# Slide 5: Integration Complexity & Lock-In

![Integration Complexity](../images/slide5.png)

## Content Type: Problem Statement

```
INTEGRATION COMPLEXITY & LOCK-IN

• Custom adapters required per platform
• Proprietary APIs create vendor dependence
• 76% report integration bottlenecks
• Security features siloed within platforms
```

## Design Elements

- **Headline**: Original problem-focused headline preserved
- **Integration Diagram**: Visual showing complex integration challenges
- **Lock-In Visualization**: Clear representation of vendor lock-in
- **Bottleneck Illustration**: Visual showing integration delays
- **Typography**: Large, bold text for key statistics

## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"The third challenge partners face is the growing complexity of integrations and problematic vendor lock-in that limits flexibility."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "Legacy approaches require creating and maintaining custom adapters for each platform, dramatically increasing costs and timelines."
2. "Proprietary APIs and data formats create significant vendor dependence, limiting strategic flexibility and negotiating power."
3. "According to recent research, 76% of organizations report that integration bottlenecks are now their primary technical challenge."
4. "Security and verification features remain siloed within specific platforms, making consistent security policies nearly impossible."

**Industry-specific angles:**
- For financial services: "Financial institutions typically manage 10-15 disparate systems with inconsistent security models."
- For media: "Media organizations struggle with disconnected asset management systems preventing unified verification."
- For technology: "For your customers, these integration challenges create significant maintenance overhead and satisfaction issues."

**Key transition:**
"Our content-addressable approach fundamentally transforms these integration models with a universal verification and storage layer."
