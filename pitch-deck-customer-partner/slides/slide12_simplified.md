## Pitch Notes

**Opening statement:**
"Early partners have already validated significant business value through our integration, with measurable impact across different industries."

**Financial services example:**
"A financial services platform achieved 42% storage reduction across their client base and added compliance capabilities that created new revenue streams—all with just a 6-week implementation timeline."

**Media example:**
"A media distribution platform reduced storage costs by 38%, enhanced their rights management capabilities, and launched a new premium 'verified content' offering that created an entirely new revenue stream."

**Enterprise software example:**
"An enterprise document management system reduced their customers' storage requirements by 35% and increased their average deal size by 22% by adding our verification capabilities."

**Reference availability:**
"While these examples are anonymized for confidentiality, we can arrange direct conversations with reference partners under NDA as part of your evaluation."

**Remember**: Use these success stories as proof points that address the specific interests the partner has expressed during your conversation.
