## Design Principles Applied

1. **Maximum 5 Bullet Points Per Slide**
   - Each slide contains only essential points
   - Supporting details moved to presenter notes

2. **Brief Bullet Points**
   - Most bullets limited to 5-7 words
   - No bullet exceeds 10 words

3. **Focused Headlines**
   - All headlines 2-5 words
   - Clear, action-oriented messaging

4. **Visual Priority**
   - Text reduced to 30-40% of slide space
   - Visuals carry primary communication burden

5. **Readable Typography**
   - Minimum 24pt for all text
   - Key metrics and headlines emphasized

## Presentation Approach

When presenting this simplified deck:

1. **Rely on Verbal Communication**
   - Use the detailed speaker notes to guide your verbal presentation
   - Explain context and details not visible on slides
   - Share specific examples relevant to the partner's industry

2. **Engage Through Questions**
   - Pause after problem slides to confirm relevance
   - Ask which benefits resonate most with their business
   - Discuss which partnership model aligns with their strategy

3. **Support with Leave-Behind Materials**
   - Provide detailed one-pagers after the presentation
   - Share case studies relevant to their industry
   - Follow up with technical documentation as appropriate

4. **Tailor Focus Areas**
   - Spend more time on the slides most relevant to this partner
   - Skip or quickly cover less relevant sections
   - Adapt industry examples based on partner business

Remember, an effective pitch deck supports your presentation—it doesn't replace it. These simplified slides create a framework for meaningful conversation rather than reading text aloud.
