# Simplified Customer & Partner Pitch Deck

## Overview

This simplified pitch deck follows presentation best practices with significantly reduced text on each slide. The deck maintains the same powerful messaging while letting visuals and your verbal delivery carry the details.

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Maximum 5 Bullet Points Per Slide**
   - Each slide contains only essential points
   - Supporting details moved to presenter notes

2. **Brief Bullet Points**
   - Most bullets limited to 5-7 words
   - No bullet exceeds 10 words

3. **Focused Headlines**
   - All headlines 2-5 words
   - Clear, action-oriented messaging

4. **Visual Priority**
   - Text reduced to 30-40% of slide space
   - Visuals carry primary communication burden

5. **Readable Typography**
   - Minimum 24pt for all text
   - Key metrics and headlines emphasized

## Presentation Approach

When presenting this simplified deck:

1. **Rely on Verbal Communication**
   - Use the detailed speaker notes to guide your verbal presentation
   - Explain context and details not visible on slides
   - Share specific examples relevant to the partner's industry

2. **Engage Through Questions**
   - Pause after problem slides to confirm relevance
   - Ask which benefits resonate most with their business
   - Discuss which partnership model aligns with their strategy

3. **Support with Leave-Behind Materials**
   - Provide detailed one-pagers after the presentation
   - Share case studies relevant to their industry
   - Follow up with technical documentation as appropriate

4. **Tailor Focus Areas**
   - Spend more time on the slides most relevant to this partner
   - Skip or quickly cover less relevant sections
   - Adapt industry examples based on partner business

## Next Steps

1. Complete simplification of remaining slides using the same principles
2. Create design mockups with proper visual elements
3. Develop one-page leave-behind materials with detailed information
4. Create a short demonstration video of key integration points

Remember, an effective pitch deck supports your presentationâ€”it doesn't replace it. These simplified slides create a framework for meaningful conversation rather than reading text aloud.
