## Decentralized Immutable Source of Truth

![DISOT](../images/slide8.png)


## Building on CAS:

- **Uses digital signatures to allow mutable data**
  - Combines content immutability with data evolution
  - Identity linked to content through cryptographic proof
  - [Source: Digital Signatures in Distributed Systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20472-7_7)

- **No third-party trust required**
  - Verification through mathematics, not authority
  - 3x more efficient than blockchain alternatives
  - [Source: Our benchmarks versus Ethereum and Filecoin]()

- **Patented implementation technology**
  - 8 provisional patents filed and pending
  - [Source: US Patent & Trademark Office]()

> *"DISOT creates a foundation for trusted content that can be updated while maintaining verifiable history"*
