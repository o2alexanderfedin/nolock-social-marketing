# Manual Google Slides Update Instructions

Due to the complexities of programmatically updating Google Slides, this document provides step-by-step instructions for manually updating the Google Slides presentation with the content from our investor pitch deck.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Open the Google Slides presentation**:
   - Go to: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nB_qDZdPiVAA8KbGzatFYnzW24-rE5NSAamyvGgxrcU/edit
   - Make sure you're logged in with the appropriate Google account

2. **Have the content source ready**:
   - Navigate to the directory: `/Users/alexanderfedin/Projects/nolock.social/marketing/pitch-deck-investor-full/slides`
   - You can open these files in a text editor to easily copy content

## Updating Each Slide

For each slide 1-21, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Navigate to the corresponding slide in Google Slides
- Use the slide panel on the left to select the slide you want to update

### Step 2: Open the corresponding markdown file
- Open the file: `slide[XX].md` where `[XX]` is the slide number (e.g., `slide01.md` for slide 1)

### Step 3: Update the slide content
- **Title**: Copy the main heading (starts with `#`) and update the slide title
- **Subtitle**: Copy the subheading (starts with `##`) and update the slide subtitle
- **Summary**: Copy the italicized text (surrounded by `*`) and add it to the slide
- **Main Content**: Copy the bullet points and other content as needed

### Step 4: Review the slide

## Tips For Effective Updating

1. **Copy in small sections**: Rather than trying to copy entire slides at once, update section by section
2. **Maintain formatting**: Pay attention to bullet points, numbered lists, and emphasis
3. **Keep visual elements**: Don't remove or replace existing images unless necessary
4. **Check links**: Make sure any hyperlinks in the content are properly transferred
5. **Save frequently**: Google Slides auto-saves, but it's good practice to ensure changes are saved

## Completing the Update

After updating all slides:
1. Review the entire presentation for consistency
2. Make sure transitions between slides flow well
3. Test the presentation in presentation mode to see how it looks full screen
4. Share the updated presentation with your team for feedback
