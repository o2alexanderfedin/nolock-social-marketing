PROBLEMS WE ARE SOLVING 
SPAM AFTER 
REGISTRATION 
Data Vendor Lock-In: 
Users lose control of their data and risk 
data loss when switching providers. 
Fragmentation of Services: 
Siloed digital services create redundant 
efforts and inconsistent experiences. 
Misinformation and Disinformation: 
Unverifiable content diminishes user trust 
and online accountability.
