## Content Type: Technical Deep Dive

```
CONTENT-ADDRESSABLE STORAGE

• Storage unaware of content structure or relationships
• Cryptographic hash functions verify data integrity
• Address points directly to data, not location
• Foundation for verifiable, immutable content
```

## Design Elements

- **Headline**: Bold, attention-grabbing typography presenting the key concept
- **Bullet Points**: Concise statements highlighting the main aspects
- **Supporting Visual**: Clear visual representation of the concept
- **Layout**: Professional organization with clear hierarchy
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent with overall presentation branding

## Pitch Notes

**Key message:**
"This slide provides a more detailed explanation of Content-Addressable Storage technology, showing how it forms the foundation of our approach."

**Supporting points:**
1. "Storage unaware of content structure or relationships"
2. "Cryptographic hash functions verify data integrity"
3. "Address points directly to data, not location"
4. "Foundation for verifiable, immutable content"

**Evidence/Impact:**
"Content-addressable storage creates a paradigm shift in how we think about digital content—when the address IS the content (through its hash), we gain powerful new capabilities for verification, deduplication, and decentralization."

## Follow-Up Slide

This slide connects to the next slide, continuing the logical flow of the presentation narrative.
