## Pitch Notes

**Delivery approach:**
"Our vision is simple but transformative: we're creating a digital ecosystem where individuals have true ownership of their content and connections."

**Key points to emphasize:**
1. "First, everyone creates immutable content they truly own—not the platform."
2. "Users have complete control to share publicly, with specific connections, or keep content private and encrypted."
3. "This content remains authentic and verifiable through our technical architecture."
4. "Most importantly, connections between users are based on real trust, not algorithmic recommendations."

**Addressing objections:**
"While we acknowledge that bad actors exist in any system, our approach prioritizes strengthening genuine connections rather than attempting perfect moderation—a more natural, human-centric approach to filtering information."

## Impact Statement

"This vision represents a fundamental shift from how digital spaces work today—moving from platform control to user autonomy, from manipulated feeds to authentic connections, and from fragmented identities to cohesive digital presence."

## Follow-Up Slide

This vision slide leads naturally to Slide 6, which explains how our trust network model functions in practice.
